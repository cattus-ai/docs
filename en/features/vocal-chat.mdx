### Language Support

Vocal Chat supports **every language**. You can speak in any language you prefer, whether it's English, French, Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, or any other language. The only requirement is to **speak clearly and distinctly** so the system can accurately understand your input.

## Tips & Tricks

To get the best results from vocal chat:

1. **Use Natural Language**: Speak as you would normally converse. The AI understands context and natural phrasing better than rigid commands.
2. **Speak in Phrases**: Break complex requests into smaller, digestible phrases rather than one long sentence.
3. **Pause Between Thoughts**: Give the system a moment to process between different topics or questions for clearer understanding.
4. **Use Voice Commands**: Learn common voice commands like "repeat that", "go back", or "new conversation" for faster navigation.
5. **Adjust Microphone Settings**: Fine-tune microphone sensitivity and noise cancellation in settings for your specific environment.
6. **Test Your Audio**: Before important sessions, test your microphone and speakers to ensure optimal audio quality.

<Tip>
Vocal chat works best in quiet environments. The system automatically detects when you've finished speaking, so natural pauses between thoughts help ensure accurate transcription.
</Tip>

<Info>
The AI will process your voice input and generate responses in both audio and text format. You can read the transcript in the chat while listening to the spoken response.

<Warning>
For sensitive or confidential information, consider using text-based chat instead of vocal chat to maintain privacy in shared environments.

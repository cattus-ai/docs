### Native Integration

Web search is built directly into all models, meaning:

- **Seamless Experience**: The model decides when to search based on your query
- **Universal Access**: Available across all AI models in Cattus
- **Always Current**: Get the most recent information available online

### Crafting Effective Queries

To get the best results from web search:

1. **Be Specific**: Include relevant details like dates, locations, or specific topics
2. **Indicate Recency**: Use phrases like "latest," "current," or "recent" when appropriate
3. **Ask Directly**: Frame questions naturally as you would when searching online
4. **Request Sources**: Ask the model to provide sources when you need to verify information

### Examples

```text Good Query
What are the latest features announced for Python 3.13?

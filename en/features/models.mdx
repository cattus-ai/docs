<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsInline
  className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl"
  src="/videos/multi-model.mp4"
>
</video>

2. Using '@' command:

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsInline
  className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl"
  src="/videos/multi-model@.mp4"

## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Model

Consider these factors when selecting a model:

1. **Task Complexity**: Use more advanced models for complex reasoning and analysis
2. **Response Speed**: Opt for faster models when quick responses are needed
3. **Context Length**: Choose models with larger context windows for longer documents
4. **Specialization**: Some models excel at specific tasks like coding or creative writing

## Tips & Tricks

<Tip>
Save your preferred model selections for different types of tasks to streamline your workflow.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Switching models mid-conversation creates a new context. The new model won't have the same "memory" of previous exchanges unless you explicitly reference them.
</Warning>

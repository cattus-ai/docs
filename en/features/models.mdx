## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Model

Consider these factors when selecting a model:

1. **Task Complexity**: Use more advanced models for complex reasoning and analysis
2. **Response Speed**: Opt for faster models when quick responses are needed
3. **Context Length**: Choose models with larger context windows for longer documents
4. **Specialization**: Some models excel at specific tasks like coding or creative writing

### Example Use Cases

<Accordion title="Code Generation">
  Select models known for strong coding capabilities when working on programming tasks. These models can help with debugging, writing functions, and explaining code.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Creative Writing">
  Use models optimized for creative tasks when generating stories, marketing copy, or other creative content.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Data Analysis">
  Choose models with strong analytical capabilities for interpreting data, identifying patterns, and providing insights.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="General Conversation">

</Accordion>

## Tips

<Tip>
Save your preferred model selections for different types of tasks to streamline your workflow.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Switching models mid-conversation creates a new context. The new model won't have the same "memory" of previous exchanges unless you explicitly reference them.
</Warning>
